# Keylogger using Python

This simple Python keylogger captures and logs keystrokes using the pynput library. The keylogger records the pressed keys and appends them to a log file (log.txt). The script utilizes the keyboard.Listener class from pynput.keyboard to listen for key presses and execute the KeyPressed function.
